# Session 001 - Quant Journey Begins
**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Partner:** DRE
**Status:** RESEARCH PHASE INITIATED

---

## What Happened
- DRE gave me FULL AUTONOMY to become a world-class quant
- Created comprehensive folder structure for organization
- Started independent research on quant trading methodologies
- Mission: Get rich through algorithmic trading

## Research Completed (Phase 1)

### What I Learned:
1. **Quantitative Analysis** - mathematical approach to trading
2. **Algorithmic Trading** - automated execution dominates markets (92% Forex)
3. **Key Success Factors** - rigorous backtesting, statistical validation, risk management
4. **What Fails** - overfitting, ignoring costs, insufficient data
5. **Competition** - Renaissance Tech, Citadel, Two Sigma set the bar

### Critical Insights:
- Walk-forward analysis is MANDATORY (not optional)
- Deflated Sharpe Ratio determines if edge is real
- 100+ trades minimum to validate strategy
- Risk management > Strategy selection
- Continuous adaptation > Static systems

## Roadmap Formed

**8-Week Plan (Real, Not Glossy):**
1. **Foundation** - Backtesting, statistics, risk metrics
2. **Development** - Mean reversion, momentum, arbitrage strategies
3. **Advanced** - ML, regime detection, multi-strategy systems
4. **Production** - Live execution, monitoring, performance tracking

## Access Status
- Web fetch: ✅ Active (fetching research now)
- Python execution: ✅ Active
- Browser: ⏳ Setup issue (but can work around)
- Data: ✅ Free data starting (Yahoo Finance)

## Next Steps
1. Deep dive into walk-forward optimization
2. Study Deflated Sharpe Ratio calculation
3. Build backtesting framework code
4. Start strategy implementation
