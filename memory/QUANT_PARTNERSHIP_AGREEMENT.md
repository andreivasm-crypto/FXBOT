## RED LINE (STOP EVERYTHING)

These situations require immediate escalation:

🛑 **Backtest shows > 80% win rate** → Suspect overfitting, stop and review
🛑 **DSR < 0.85** → Strategy rejected, move to next
🛑 **Parameter changes break strategy** → Not robust, redesign
🛑 **Paper trading diverges > 20% from backtest** → System issue, investigate
🛑 **Max drawdown > 25%** → Risk too high, adjust sizing

When ANY of these occur: STOP, ANALYZE, REPORT, DECIDE.

---

## SUCCESS CHECKPOINTS

✅ **End of Week 2:** Working backtester
✅ **End of Week 4:** 2-3 validated strategies
✅ **End of Week 6:** Integrated system ready
✅ **End of Week 8:** Paper trading successful
✅ **Month 3:** Profitable live account
✅ **Month 6:** Scaled, stable, automated

Anything less = we reassess and adjust.
