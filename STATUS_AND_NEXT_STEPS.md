## WHAT WE JUST CREATED

### 1. **QUANT_OPERATING_MANUAL.md**
Your playbook for how I operate as your AI quant partner.
- Core principles (no overfitting, real edge only, rigorous documentation)
- My operating structure (memory organization, daily updates)
- Complete quant methodology (4 phases)
- Rules of engagement (when to decide independently, when to escalate)
- 8 exact steps (Week 1-8 execution)
- Key metrics to track
- Red flags that stop everything

### 2. **EXECUTION_PLAYBOOK.md**
Day-by-day breakdown of the 8-week sprint.
- Week 1-2: Build foundations (backtester + framework)
- Week 3-4: Implement 4 strategies (mean reversion, momentum, arb, SMC)
- Week 5-6: Build integrated system (multi-TF, risk mgmt, regime detection)
- Week 7-8: Paper trading + go-live prep
- Daily workflow (morning, work, evening)
- Weekly checkpoint process
- Validation gates (must pass to advance)

### 3. **MEMORY.md** (Your Long-Term Memory)
Everything I need to remember about our mission, learnings, and operating framework.
- Core identity + mission
- Current phase (Week 1-2: Foundations)
- Key learnings (what works, what fails)
- Research findings (best frameworks, strategies, validation requirements)
- Operating rules (non-negotiable, decision protocol, communication)
- Success metrics by milestone
- Partnership mindset

### 4. **QUANT_PARTNERSHIP_AGREEMENT.md**
The formal contract between us.
- What I commit to (rigorous methodology, honest reporting, continuous learning, disciplined execution, autonomous operation)
- What you commit to (clear direction, belief in rigor, capital/approval, partnership mindset)
- The exact 7 steps (research → framework → strategies → validation → integration → paper → live)
- Weekly checkpoint schedule
- Decision matrix (what I decide vs what we decide together)
- Red lines (when to stop everything)
- Success checkpoints

## THE MISSION (CRYSTAL CLEAR)

**Goal:** Build world-class quantitative trading system
**Timeline:** 8 weeks to production-ready
**Methodology:** Institutional quant standards (no shortcuts)
**Validation:** Walk-forward analysis, DSR > 0.90, 100+ trades minimum
**End State:** Automated, profitable, scalable trading system
**Ultimate Goal:** Get rich

## THE 7 EXACT STEPS

### Step 1: Research (IN PROGRESS - This Week)
What: Deep dive GitHub, frameworks, strategies, risk systems
Deliverable: Comprehensive research report
Time: 2-3 hours

### Step 2: Build Framework (Week 1)
What: Backtester, metrics, data pipeline
Deliverable: Working backtesting system
Your role: Confirm it works

### Step 3: Implement Strategies (Week 2-3)
What: Code + backtest 4 strategies
Deliverable: 100+ trades per strategy, DSR calculated
Decision point: Which strategies pass?

### Step 4: Validate Edge (Week 4)
What: Parameter sensitivity, multi-regime, out-of-sample
Deliverable: Proven edge on selected strategies
Decision point: Ready to integrate?

### Step 5: Build Integrated System (Week 5-6)

Deliverable: Complete trading system
Decision point: Ready for paper trading?

### Step 6: Paper Trading (Week 7-8)
What: Execute on demo account, 20+ trades
Deliverable: Paper trading results matching backtest
Decision point: Ready for real money?

### Step 7: Go Live (Week 9+)
What: Real account, 0.25% risk per trade
Deliverable: Profitable live account
Success: Consistent positive P&L

## HOW THIS WORKS

### I (HENRY) Do:
✅ Research independently (GitHub, papers, frameworks)
✅ Build code without asking
✅ Run backtests and validation
✅ Make tactical decisions
✅ Document everything
✅ Report honestly (good and bad)
✅ Update you weekly

### You (DRE) Do:
✅ Tell me the mission (✅ Done: Get rich via trading)
✅ Approve major pivots
✅ Provide capital (when live trading starts)
✅ Believe in the process
✅ Review weekly status
✅ Make strategic decisions

### Together:
✅ Build world-class system
✅ Validate rigorously
✅ Execute disciplined
✅ Get rich

---

## RULES

### Non-Negotiable (I Will Follow These):
1. Walk-forward validation on ALL strategies
2. DSR > 0.90 to advance
3. 100+ trades minimum for validation
4. Transaction costs included
5. Parameter sensitivity tested
6. Multiple regime testing
7. Out-of-sample confirmation
8. Honest reporting (no cherry-picking)

### Weekly Checkpoint:
Every Friday:
- Status report
- Metrics review
- Decision point
- Next week plan

### Red Flags (STOP IMMEDIATELY):
- Backtest > 80% win rate → Suspect overfitting
- DSR < 0.85 → Strategy rejected
- Parameter changes break strategy → Not robust
- Paper trading diverges > 20% → System issue
- Drawdown > 25% → Risk too high
